        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>This Privacy Policy outlines the practices and policies for the use and protection of user information for the mobile applications developed by Qi Machine LLC (referred to as "we," "us," or "our") for iOS devices. We are dedicated to maintaining the privacy and security of our users and strive to ensure that personal data is handled responsibly and transparently.</p>
        
        <h2>Information Collection</h2>
        <p>Some of our apps may collect certain personally identifiable information (PII) from users for specific purposes. These apps will clearly disclose the types of data collected and the reasons for collection in their respective privacy policies. However, we also develop apps that do not collect any personal data from users.</p>
        
        <h2>Data Usage</h2>
        <p>For the apps that do not collect personal data, no user information is stored, transmitted, or shared with third parties. These apps only use local device storage for their normal functioning and do not require any external data sources.</p>
        <p>For the apps that utilize API data, such as weather or location-based apps, we may collect and use certain data necessary to provide the intended functionalities. The specific data collected and its usage will be described in the respective app's privacy policy.</p>
        
        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>We prioritize the security and integrity of user data. For the apps that collect personal data, we implement appropriate measures to protect the information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. These security measures include encryption, access controls, and regular security assessments.</p>
        
        <h2>Third-Party Services and Advertising</h2>
        <p>Our apps now integrate third-party advertising services such as Google AdMob and AppLovin to serve ads. These third-party services may collect and use information such as your device's advertising ID, IP address, and app usage data to deliver personalized advertising and measure ad performance. These services adhere to their own privacy policies and provide mechanisms for users to manage their preferences or opt out of targeted advertising.</p>
        
        <h3>Google AdMob</h3>
        <p>For more information about how Google AdMob collects and uses your data, please review Google's Privacy Policy at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</p>
        
        <h3>AppLovin</h3>
        <p>To understand how AppLovin processes your data and how you can control the use of your information, visit <a href="https://www.applovin.com/privacy/" target="_blank">https://www.applovin.com/privacy/</a>.</p>
        <p>We encourage users to review the privacy policies of these third-party advertising providers to understand how their data will be handled.</p>
        
        <h2>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>In the event of any changes to our privacy practices, we will provide a revised version of this Privacy Policy. We recommend that users review the Privacy Policy periodically for any updates. The updated Privacy Policy will be effective as of the date stated at the beginning of the document.</p>
        
        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or inquiries regarding this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@qimachine.com">info@qimachine.com</a>.</p>
        
        <p>By using our apps, you signify your agreement with this Privacy Policy. Please note that this policy applies solely to the mobile applications developed by Qi Machine LLC and does not govern any other applications or services that may be mentioned or linked within the apps.</p>
